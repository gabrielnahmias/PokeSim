**HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:**
<br>
>**Windows Users:**

1. Press <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and insert
   "cmd" without quotes into the text box. Then, copy the
   path of this archive's extraction and either type it into
   the console (cmd) after the prior `cd` command, or paste it
   (via *QuickEdit* mode, etc.), then type in (the `rem` lines are unnecessary to type; they are merely for advice, et al.):

	<div style="color:#000020; background:#f6f8ff;">
	<pre>
	<span style="color:#595979;">rem You may need quotes around the bracketed stuff</span><span style="color:#595979;">rem but probably not.</span>
	cd {CURRENT DIRECTORY HERE}
	cls
	<span style="color:#595979;">rem This will only work if you have modified your</span>
	<span style="color:#595979;">rem environment variables to reflect Java"s installation</span>
	<span style="color:#595979;">rem path. Also, you can include the full path of the</span>
	<span style="color:#595979;">rem following bytecode file. This makes it simpler.</span>
	java PokemonSimulator
	</pre>
	</div>

>**Linux Users:**

1. I don't have time to test this out on Ubuntu right now but as it is, Java is cross-platform as it gets. This is why Google chose it as its language of choice for the Android platform. The entire SDK for the mobile device platform is Java-based and includes other tools. You're a geek—figure it out.

**Instructions:**
>*Make your console (`cmd`) fullscreen (on Windows 7, the console appears to the left when clicking the maximize button) and everything will flow a lot more smoothly.* Follow the above guide and you should be fine.
